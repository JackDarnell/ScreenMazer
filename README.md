# ScreenMazer

ScreenMazer is a screensaver for Mac that builds a maze, and then solves it, repetitively.  I had this idea a while back watching some gifs of maze generation, and so I made it!

## Installation:
1. Download the [latest zip file](https://github.com/dado3212/ScreenMazer/raw/master/ScreenMazer.zip), and extract ScreenMazer.saver from the .zip file.  Then double click to add it to Settings.  Feel free to customize it!

Alternatively, you can build it from the source here.
